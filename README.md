# AR Object Manipulation

AR Object Manipulation is a Unity project that allows users to interact with virtual objects in an augmented reality (AR) environment. Users can instantiate objects, move them around, rotate them, and scale them using touch gestures.

## Features

- Object Instantiation: Tap on the AR surface to instantiate a virtual object at that location.
- Object Movement: Move the instantiated object by dragging it with your finger on the screen.
- Object Rotation: Rotate the instantiated object by using a two-finger gesture.
- Object Scaling: Scale the instantiated object by using a three-finger gesture.
- Object Reset: Reset the scale of the instantiated object to its original size.

## Getting Started

To get started with the AR Object Manipulation project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the project in Unity Editor (compatible with Unity version 19.4.11+).
3. Ensure you have the AR Foundation and ARKit or ARCore packages imported into your project.
4. Build and deploy the project to your target AR device (iOS or Android).
5. Run the application on the device and interact with the virtual objects using touch gestures.

## How to Use

1. Run the application on your AR device.
2. Point the device's camera at a flat surface to enable AR tracking.
3. Tap on the screen to instantiate a virtual object at the tapped location.
4. Use a single finger to drag the object and move it around the scene.
5. Use a two-finger gesture to rotate the object.
6. Use a three-finger gesture to scale the object.
7. To reset the object's scale, press the "Reset" button provided in the UI.

## Notes

- Make sure the AR camera is properly set up and configured in the scene for accurate object tracking and placement.
- The project assumes the availability of an AR Foundation-supported device with ARKit or ARCore.
- Ensure that the necessary AR packages are imported and up to date in your project.
